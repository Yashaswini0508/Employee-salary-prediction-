# 💼 Employee Salary Prediction

This project predicts whether an employee earns **more than \$50K or less than \$50K** per year using machine learning classification techniques. It uses the **UCI Adult Income Dataset** and is deployed via a **Streamlit web app**.

---

## 📊 Dataset

* **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository
* **Features**: Age, Education, Occupation, Marital Status, etc.
* **Target**: Income (`>50K` or `<=50K`)

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

* **Python**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**
* **Scikit-learn** for model building
* **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** for visualization
* **Streamlit** for deployment
* **Joblib** for saving the model

---

## 🔁 Workflow

1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
2. EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
3. Model Training (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.)
4. Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix)
5. Deployment via Streamlit

---

## 🌐 Streamlit App

* Users input details like age, workclass, education, etc.
* App predicts salary category
* Styled with a peach-pink theme for better UI

---

## ✅ Results

* Best accuracy achieved with **Random Forest**
* Improved predictions after proper encoding and scaling
* Future scope: hyperparameter tuning, more model comparisons
